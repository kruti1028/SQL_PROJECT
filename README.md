# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
My project objective is to efficiently clean up this data and generate insightful analysis.


## Process
(your step 1)
1. input CSV file into pg admin
2. trying to understand all given table
3. wrote data manipulation SQL queries for cleaning data, and making it in a readable format(i.e. changing the time integer to time.)
4. wrote data SQL queries to solve the assignment.

### 
(your step 2)
1. wrote my own data analysis question and solved it using PGADMIN.
2. tried to create an ERD diagram but there are a lot of sufficient data so it's hard to connect them with each other 


## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)
As per my analysis, I discovered that the majority of revenue was generated in the United States with $13,154  and the second is Israel where revenue was generated at $602.
